Welcome! I’m a doctoral candidate in Political Science at Northwestern University. I’m interested in political economy, political organizations and movements, and inequality. My dissertation project studies how power and precarity in workplaces and labor markets affects political life in the United States.

My work has been published in _[Party Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13540688231199448)_ and my current research is supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, the APSA Centennial Center, and the Consortium for the American Political Economy.

On these pages you can learn more about what I'm working on. My school also did a very nice profile on me that you can read [here](https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/about/our-people/spotlight/jack-garigliano-hehim.html).
