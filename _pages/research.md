      My dissertation will study the political implications of growing job precarity across multiple levels of the labor market. This trend has upended the implicit social contract traditionally held in higher-income positions, in which workers receive subsidized benefits through their job, while further deteriorating working conditions in lower-income positions. In the proposed set of projects, I aim to study how employment precarity, intersecting with a racially stratified and gendered labor market, impacts the political system in three different areas. First, I study how precarity influences political attitudes towards public and private modes of distributing resources, paying special attention to the legacy of the US’ employment-oriented means of distributing benefits. Next, I study how precarity influences electoral politics, identifying changes in electoral participation and partisan identification within and between individuals over the time period of interest, then studying changes in mass partisan coalitions over the same time period at the aggregate level. Finally, I look to identify cases where the aggregate growth of precarity at local levels are associated with non-electoral mobilization, including within the workplace itself. Through these approaches, I hope to construct a better understanding of the material foundations of the political transformations that have unfolded over the last several decades.

      Mainstream European left-wing parties have seen their traditional class base evolve in postindustrial economies. In response, these parties have adopted redistributive strategies that aim to secure positions for workers in a more volatile labor market through education and training. But how does the electoral appeal of this “social investment” paradigm compare to that of the older welfare paradigm that passively distributes benefits to the poor and inactive? Using cross-country data from two surveys, I find that the policy preferences of industrial workers respond differently to labor market precarity than do those of service sector workers, particularly sociocultural professionals. Further, industrial workers who prefer traditional welfare policies are less likely to vote for the center-left than white-collar professionals, even if those professionals hold similar policy priorities. These results help explain the center-left’s recent electoral trends while also highlighting current limitations on building cross-class political coalitions
